# RNA Library
Generates a large amount of mRNA sequences via ViennaRNA's inverse folding and generates metrics for later physical synthesis and exploration of mRNA's secondary structure.

## Requisite Software
The most current code for this project utilyzes Python 3.8 and R 3.6.3 syntax 

We use the ViennaRNA Package which can be found [here](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/) for folding and inverse folding functionality

The external R package, 'gkmSVM' is also a requisite for certain metric generation functionality, which may be found [here](http://www.beerlab.org/gkmsvm/)
